-------------------
* Allow building with GHC 9.2.

3.12.2
------
* Fix the build with `fingertree-0.1.2` or later. Since `fingertree-0.1.2` now
  provides a `Semigroup` instance for `FingerTree`, as a result
  `Data.Semigroup.Instances` no longer exports anything if building against
  `fingertree-0.1.2` or later with `base-4.9` or later.
* Removed a couple of redundant instance constraints
* GHC 8 compatibility
* `transformers` 0.5 compatibility
