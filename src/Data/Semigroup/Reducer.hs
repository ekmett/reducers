-- | This type may be best read infix. A @c `Reducer` m@ is a 'Semigroup' @m@ that maps
-- values of type @c@ through @unit@ to values of type @m@. A @c@-'Reducer' may also
-- supply operations which tack-on another @c@ to an existing 'Monoid' @m@ on the left
-- or right. These specialized reductions may be more efficient in some scenarios
-- and are used when appropriate by a 'Generator'. The names 'cons' and 'snoc' work
-- by analogy to the synonymous operations in the list monoid.
--
-- This class deliberately avoids functional-dependencies, so that () can be a @c@-Reducer
-- for all @c@, and so many common reducers can work over multiple types, for instance,
-- First and Last may reduce both @a@ and 'Maybe' @a@. Since a 'Generator' has a fixed element
-- type, the input to the reducer is generally known and extracting from the monoid usually
-- is sufficient to fix the result type. Combinators are available for most scenarios where
-- this is not the case, and the few remaining cases can be handled by using an explicit 
-- type annotation.
